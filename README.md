## Overview

### A web-app for HTKâ€™s creative workshops. 

#### During the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, # HTK Sverige have to move our workshops from in-house to outdoors and online. Our present website is not very interactive and does not maintain the attention of the members, neither does it allow for member interaction. Our audience are children, parents, teachers and facilitators. 

#### We have many creative activities to offer and the app should reflect this!
 
### Description

The App is designed to provide a platform for the search and sale of creative arts services.

- *"We are keen to get involved, but would like to contact someone via email to discuss in more depth"*

#### 1.	Strategy

##### Project Goals:
The aim of this project is to grow awareness and community support, hence keeping the UX simple and user-friendly and providing relevant information on how people can get involved.

##### Customer Goals:

As a User:

- I want to know when the next 8 week workshop starts for Kizomba
- Do I need to be a member to get discounts
- I want to see exactly where the workshops happen and how to get there
- Can I pay in advance for 1, 3 or 6months
- I want to know how many classes you have per week 
- I want know if there is anyone I know that goes to your workshops

#### 2.	Scope

- A 4 application layout for easy navigation: Home, Booking, Shop and Newsletter
- Simple, clean layout for easy readability
- Quickly defines the content, focus on options available and point of contact.

#### 3.	Structure

The main focus of the structure is to allow Users to quickly assimilate the information and keep them engaged till point of sale/ contact. Short, focused paragraphs of content information and inviting imagery. 

Customers will be able to register and access their own page. From this perspective they can alter or confirm their order/interest. They may also be able to send a query regarding their interests.

Points of contact are provided via email contact form, registration area and direct sales form and  button.

### Deployment

Steps taken to deploy on Github

1. My code was written in Gitpod, uploaded and hosted on Heroku and transferred to Github.
2. In Github it is stored on a public repository: 
3. Under services in Github, follow instructions to deploy.
4. The code is now available for anyone to access via Github pages

Now available on Github and Heroku


## Version Control

The code can be run locally through clone or download.  
Open the repository and in the main 'code' section there is a button 'clone or download'.  
This button will provide a link that you can use on your desktop or download as a ZIP file.

## Project Barriers and Solutions

It was fun working with Django and Python, and with some more time and less pressure I believe I will grasp the full essence.
