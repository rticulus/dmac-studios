        <h2>Working With Artists</h2>
        <p>
            We work to support artists. We work as an agency to engage dance and movement practitioners in workshops, we support master classes and artistic development, we have a start-up programme for fledgling artists and we support several education projects. We aim to promote artists wherever we can, and also to encourage communities in Bristol to engage with regular healthy activity on a weekly basis. We work with schools, community groups and events to promote dance as an essential part of modern living, and we have several partnerships developing in Bristol and beyond.

        Our studios rate as some of the best dance spaces in Bristol. The studios are available at weekends and occasionally in the week for bigger workshops, private hire and rehearsals.

        Most of our classes are available on MoveGB, please check their website for sign up details, https://www.movegb.com/move-more/bristol
